## 💡 Demo Tips

### Best Practices

- Wait 2-3 seconds between actions for clarity
- Use cursor highlights to draw attention
- Show both high and low probability results
- Demonstrate theme switching during demo
- Point out the smooth animations

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this using real data?**
A: This is a simulation demonstrating the UI/UX. In production, it would connect to actual ML models trained on NASA Kepler/TESS data.

**Q: How accurate is the training simulation?**
A: The simulation mimics realistic ML training patterns - metrics improve over time with diminishing returns, similar to actual neural network training.

**Q: Can parameters be changed during training?**
A: Currently, the "Start Training" button is disabled during training to prevent conflicts. This could be enhanced with pause/resume functionality.

**Q: What happens to the data inputs?**
A: The current version simulates analysis. In production, these values would be fed into the trained model for actual inference.
